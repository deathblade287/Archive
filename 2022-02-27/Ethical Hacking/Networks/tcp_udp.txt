TCP & UDP - Protocols For Sneding Bits Of Data (Packets)
          - Not The Only Ones, But The Most Famous

TCP : Transmition Control Protocal (Checks All Packets & Whether User Recieved Them)
  1. Syn (Snchronized Sequence Number... CLients Want To Interact With Server)
  2. Syn/Ack (Server Replies Back)
  3. Ack (Client Ackowlodges Server)

UDP : User Data Protocol
   - Same Thing As TCP But It Doesnt Check Any Errors - Thus Faster, But More Prone To Errors
